## Dataset Features ðŸ“‹

This data set contains 416 liver patient records and 167 non liver patient records collected from North East of Andhra Pradesh, India. The "Dataset" column is a class label used to divide groups into liver patient (liver disease) or not (no disease). This data set contains 441 male patient records and 142 female patient records.

- **Age**: Older age may indicate a higher risk of liver disease.
- **Gender**: Certain liver diseases have gender-specific prevalence.
- **Total Bilirubin**: Elevated levels suggest liver dysfunction.
- **Direct Bilirubin**: Elevated levels may indicate bile duct obstruction.
- **Alkaline Phosphotase**: Elevated levels can signal liver or bone disease.
- **Alamine Aminotransferase (ALT)**: Elevated levels indicate liver damage.
- **Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST)**: Elevated levels suggest liver inflammation.
- **Total Proteins**: Changes may occur in liver disease.
- **Albumin**: Decreased levels suggest liver dysfunction.
- **Albumin and Globulin Ratio**: Provides additional insight into liver function.
- **Dataset**: Indicates whether the patient has liver disease.
- **Diagnosis**: Indicates whether the patient has diabetes.

## Inspiration ðŸ’¡

This dataset can inspire research and analysis aimed at predicting liver patient based on various clinical indicators. By examining the relationship between various parameters.
