## Dataset Features 📋

This dataset includes the following information or features:

- **Age**: Age of the patient in years.
- **Sex**: Sex of the patient (0 = Female, 1 = Male).
- **Cp**: Chest pain type 
  - 0 = Typical Angina
  - 1 = Atypical Angina
  - 2 = Non-anginal Pain
  - 3 = Asymptomatic
- **Trtbps**: Resting blood pressure in mm Hg.
- **Chol**: Cholesterol level in mg/dl fetched via BMI sensor.
- **Fbs**: Fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl (1 = True, 0 = False).
- **Restecg**: Resting electrocardiographic results 
  - 0 = Normal
  - 1 = ST-T wave normality
  - 2 = Left ventricular hypertrophy
- **Thalachh**: Maximum heart rate achieved.
- **Oldpeak**: ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest.
- **Slp**: Slope of the peak exercise ST segment.
- **Caa**: Number of major vessels colored by fluoroscopy (0-3).
- **Thall**: Thallium stress test result 
  - 0 = Normal
  - 1 = Fixed defect
  - 2 = Reversible defect
- **Exng**: Exercise induced angina (1 = Yes, 0 = No).
- **Output**: Target variable indicating the presence of heart disease (1 = Prone to heart attack, 0 = Not prone to heart attack).

## Inspiration 💡

This dataset provides a rich resource for understanding and predicting heart disease risk. By analyzing various clinical indicators such as age, sex, chest pain type, cholesterol levels, and more, researchers can develop models to identify individuals at high risk of heart attacks. This can aid in early diagnosis and preventive healthcare measures.
