# Knee Osteoarthritis Prediction Dataset 🩸💼

Welcome to the Knee osteoarthrits Xray Dataset! 🎉 The objective of this project is to classify xrays of Knee Xrays into 5 distinct categories based on severity of the disease.

## Context 📋

Knee osteoarthritis is defined by degeneration of the knee’s articular cartilage the flexible, slippery material that normally protects bones from joint friction and impact. The condition also involves changes to the bone underneath the cartilage and can affect nearby soft tissues. Knee osteoarthritis is by far the most common type of arthritis to cause knee pain and often referred to as simply knee arthritis. Many other less common types of arthritis can also cause knee pain, including rheumatoid arthritis, pseudogout, and reactive arthritis.

## Image Descriptors 📝

The dataset consists of four subdirectories: train, test, auto test and val (test and auto_test are the same). All four contain 5 subdirectories, each representing a severity of osteoarthritis. The test and auto_test subdirectory contains 1346 images in total, while the train subdirectory contains 5778 images in total and the val subdirectory contains 826 images in total.

Each subdirectory has 5 severity grades:

0. **Grade 0**: Healthy knee image.
1. **Grade 1(Doubtful)**: Doubtful joint narrowing with possible osteophytic lipping
2. **Grade 2(Minimal)**: Definite presence of osteophytes and possible joint space narrowing 
3. **Grade 3(Moderate)**: Multiple osteophytes, definite joint space narrowing, with mild sclerosis.
4. **Grade 4(Severe)**: Large osteophytes, significant joint narrowing, and severe sclerosis.
