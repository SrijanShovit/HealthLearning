# Pneumonia Detection Using Chest X-ray Images

Welcome to the Pneumonia Detection repository! This project utilizes deep learning techniques to detect pneumonia from chest X-ray images.

## Introduction

Pneumonia is an inflammatory condition of the lung primarily affecting the small air sacs known as alveoli. Detection of pneumonia from chest X-rays can be a challenging task and requires expert radiologists. This project leverages the power of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to automate the detection of pneumonia from chest X-ray images, aiding healthcare professionals and improving diagnostic accuracy and speed.

## Features

- Preprocessing of X-ray images
- Implementation of a CNN model using TensorFlow/Keras
- Training and validation pipelines
- Evaluation metrics and performance visualization

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is sourced from the [Kaggle Chest X-ray Images (Pneumonia) dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia/data). 
It consists of X-ray images categorized into three sets: 
- Train
- Validation
- Test
  
Each set is categorised into two classes: 
- Normal
- Pneumonia
